## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Online judge applications are online platforms that allow developers to test and benchmark their code in a simulated environment.
A mobile-based online judge is a useful platform for programming students to practice and improve their coding skills. It provides a convenient and accessible way to evaluate coding challenges, especially for students without access to a desktop or laptop. It also makes it easier to participate in coding competitions from any location.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- Requires Node to be installed
- Requires `Expo` to be installed on your mobile device.
- Steps to set up Judge0 API from RapidAPI:
  1. Sign up or log in to RapidAPI.
  1. Search for "Judge0 API" and select the API from the results.
  1. Click on the "Pricing" tab to select a plan that fits your usage needs.(free plan has allows 50 requests per day).
  1. Once you have chosen a plan, click the "Subscribe" button to subscribe to the API.
  1. Click on the "Endpoints" tab to see the available endpoints for the Judge0 API.
  1. Copy the API endpoint URL and API Key from the "Code Snippets" section and use it in update enpoint in this project.

### Installing

Clone current repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/team-somehow/code-somehow.git
cd code-somehow
npm i
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

After installations,

- Open the Expo app from your IOS or Android mobile and sign in, or create an account if you don't have one.
- Run the below given command in current project folder

```
npm start
```

- Scan the QR code generated by the app while running with your mobile device using the camera or by entering the project URL in the "Projects" section of the Expo app.
- Wait for the app to build and load on your device.
- You should now be able to use the app made with React Native and Expo on your mobile device.
