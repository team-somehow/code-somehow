## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Online judge applications are online platforms that allow developers to test and benchmark their code in a simulated environment.
A mobile-based online judge is a useful platform for programming students to practice and improve their coding skills. It provides a convenient and accessible way to evaluate coding challenges, especially for students without access to a desktop or laptop. It also makes it easier to participate in coding competitions from any location.
